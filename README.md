# time.me
time.me is a mobile application that helps people keep track of the time they spend doing a certain activity. This project is intented to test its developers capabilities to resolve a real problem which is aligned with XLynXAi tech stack and use cases.

### Project Structure
The project is structured as a monorepo that includes codebases for both client and server.
```
/client (React Native Applicaton Codebase)
/server (Node + Express Backend Codebase)
```
### Required Tech Stack
- Client: Expo React Native, Nativewind
- Server: Node.js environment, Express.js REST API, MySQL/PostgreSQL or any BaaS.

### Features
- Tasks CRUD that includes: task name, description, starting and ending time (so you can measure the exact amount of time spend on the task assuming the user created the task at the same time they start working on it).

### Visual Design
The frontend developer(s) in charge of the mobile application has total freedom on the choosing of design style and components library.

### Backend Design Patterns
The backend developer(s) in charge of the REST API and server-side features must at least use a MVC pattern, more sofisticated patterns are allowed as well.
